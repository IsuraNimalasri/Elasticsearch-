# Elasticsearch-Queries
Hi all ,

This is my Elasticsearch learning page. If you want to get very simply idea about Elasticsearch queries, this will help for you....
And keep in mind ,this is not the whole idea about ES (elasticsearch). 

*! sorry note* :  
I’m not going to teach or demo about “install ES” and  “ system confutation” .Please visit Elasticsearch official web site and continue it . https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/_installation.html
(Please run  all queries in elasticsearch sense plugin )
How to install Elasticsearch sense plugin, (for 1.1.5 new ES sense plugin comes with Kibana) this is  very simple tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNr1ORM4s38 you can refer this.
